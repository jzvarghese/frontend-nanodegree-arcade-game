How to Play:
------------

The goal of the game is to move the player across the street
and into the water without hitting any of the bugs. You control
the character with the arrow keys. Upon stepping on the water tile,
the player will be transported back to the grass and earn one point,
which is displayed in the upper right hand corner. If the player
comes in contact with one of the bugs, the player is transported
back to the grass and loses all of his/her points. Blue and gold
gems will spawn on the road at random intervals as a way to boost
the players score. Blue gems are worth 2 points,
while gold gems worth 5.
